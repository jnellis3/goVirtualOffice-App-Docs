### Setting Up a Saved Search for Simple Connect

#### Example: Single Record per Row (e.g., Non-Inventory items)

1. Navigate to **Lists > Saved Searches > New**.
2. Select **Item**.
3. Name the search (suggested prefix: SC).
4. Set the search as **Public**.
5. Add the first **Criteria filter** as:
   - **Formula Numeric**: `{internalid}`
   - **Condition**: Greater than
   - **Value**: `0`
6. Add other desired criteria (e.g., Type is Non-inventory).
7. Navigate to **Results tab**.
8. First **SORT BY** field:
   - **Formula Numeric**: `{internalid}`
9. First result row:
   - **Formula Number**: `{internalid}`
   - **Custom Label**: `ROWKEY`
10. Add additional result rows as needed.

12. Save the search.

#### Example: Multiple Rows per Record (e.g., Sales Order lines)

Use the same steps as above, but for the formula:

- Formula example for multiple lines:

```plaintext
({internalid}*10000) + TO_NUMBER({line})
```

Set this formula for both the criteria and the ROWKEY in results.

#### Updating search results:
  - Double-click your query to open the power query editor.
  - Remove 'Changed Type' and 'Promoted Headers'.
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/116d9b44-8d01-45a6-ac17-f9863c83bf8c)
  - Under "Applied Steps", click on **Source** and check the contents in this step.
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/201fc109-c58f-4ed0-a5b7-16d43eed3665)

    The contents should look something like this:
    ```
    = Csv.Document(Web.Contents("https://examplesimpleconnecturl.com"),[Delimiter=",", Columns=20, Encoding=65001, QuoteStyle=QyoteStyle.None])
    ```
    If this step is specifying a format (delimiter, columns, etc.), this can all get removed. Modify the step so that it looks like this:
    ```
    = Csv.Document(Web.Contents("https://examplesimpleconnecturl.com"))
    ```
  - Click **Refresh**.
  - After refresh, click **Use First Row as Headers**.
  - If the power query is still using the old headers, delete **Changed Type** under "Applied Steps" again.
  - Click on **Promoted Headers** and refresh the query again.
  - Click **Close & Load**.

  #### Sharing your excel document with another SimpleConnect User
  - The user will need to authenticate within excel to access the connection using their own SimpleConnect credentials
  - Under the data tab navigate to Get Dataâ€”>Data Source Settings...
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39a14a3b-e108-451f-92f8-ecbc74288ad0)
  - On the Data Source Settings page that appears, **right-click** on the connection string and click **Edit Permissions**
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15dfbe8c-7de7-4d42-a971-3c39421e893d)
  - This will bring up the **edit permissions dialog**, from here, click **Edit...**
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1f3a53a-b60d-4a6b-b3aa-0ebe41f4fc66)
  - This will bring up the authentication screen. Typically this appears when the user first opens the document, but this is another way to get to this page.
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/618143fa-a3bd-4436-acd0-ede4bb7d2cd6)
  - This should be set to "Basic". The username will be the SimpleConnect username, and the password will be the password the user generated using the email link that was sent when their account was created.
  - Following these steps should allow the user to successfully connect and pull data using the shared document.
